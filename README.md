my dotfiles. they're dotfiles, so make sure you `ls -a` if you can't see them. ;)

particular bits of note:

1) per-directory history - implemented largely in .bash-functions.sh. This keeps your history nice and clean, and allows context when grepping .bash-history.d. Also syncs bash history among multiple open terminals.

2) some useful options for LESS in .bashrc

3) .irbrc fixes irb's terminal resize problems, and gives a convenient method lister for ruby objects

4) listchars in .vimrc is super useful

5) fancy config info for an xmonad setup, including a custom 'small-accordian' layout
